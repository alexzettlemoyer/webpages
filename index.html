	<p>
	My name is <strong>Alex Zettlemoyer</strong> and I'm a freshman Computer Science major.
	I chose Computer Science because I deeply enjoy problem solving, and I feel
	as though this major is the rawest form of it. I think my brain truly understands
	code and the methods of programing with much less effort than other subjects.
	Furthermore, the <em>endless possibilities</em> of programming have always fascinated me.
	I know that I could become a software engineer, a game designer, or work in medicine - 
	I chose this major because there are so many directions I could go with it.

	<p style ="font-family: Arial; font-size: 25px; color: #000000; text-align: right;">
	Currently, I work as a hostess in a breakfast restaurant called <ins>Stack's Kitchen</ins>.
	Although I wouldn't consider this as a long term job, I do genuinely enjoy it.
	The restaurant is almost always packed on the weekends and having up to an hour wait
	makes it a high-stress environment, which I usually enjoy. I only plan to have this job
	until I get a degree, but after that I don't necessarily have one concrete 'dream job.'
	I just know I would like to work somewhere in the field of Computer Science or Chemistry.
